## Story

19 â€œDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Journey of Generosity

but before that, Journey of Freedom

a way for me to focus on and reorient my goal to store treasures in heaven, not on earth
