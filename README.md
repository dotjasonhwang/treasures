## About

The year is 2023. I am working on my budgeting game. Commercial applications are a bit too centralized and un-customizable for a software nerd like myself. I am also growing in my relationship with money, and I come across the [The Finish Line Pledge](https://www.finishlinepledge.com). Combining these two threads, **Treasures** is born.

**Treasures** takes transaction sheets and consolidates a monthly budget breakdown, and the bottom line metric is based on your personal "financial finish line". The intent was to use the finish line metric to direct the focus of the budgeting from storing treasures on earth to storing them in heaven.

The Financial Finish Line is a monthly number that the Finish Line Pledge computes using household size, target percentile, and a variety of data sources. See [The Finish Line Pledge](https://www.finishlinepledge.com) for a full breakdown as well as a wealth of valuable content and resources.

Matthew 6:19-21:
â€œDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

**Disclaimer**: This is a personal project that I have tested for my own use case, and I do not guarantee correct results. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your environment is set up to run Python3
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

```
usage: driver.py [-h] -n HOUSEHOLD_SIZE -p PERCENTILE -f FILE_DIR -c CONFIG_FILE

Treasures

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, --household_size HOUSEHOLD_SIZE
                        Household size
  -p PERCENTILE, --percentile PERCENTILE
                        Target percentile of income
  -f FILE_DIR, --file_dir FILE_DIR
                        Location of the bank transactions
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                        Location of the config file, where processors are defined
```

Example:
`python3 src/driver.py -n 2 -p 50 -f my_transactions_folder/2024/01/01/ -c data/my_config_file.json`
